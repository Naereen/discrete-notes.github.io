*Discrete notes* is a blog about discrete maths and theoretical computer science, 
which are my research interests. 

A similar blog in French is *[Des notes discretes](https://des-notes-discretes.github.io)*. 
Some posts are translations, but not the majority. 
Before these blogs I used to write on *[Semidoc](https://semidoc.github.io)*, the blog of the PhD students of IRIF.

A few remarks: 

* There is no comment section, but you can send me emails, and I'll be very 
happy to answer. 
* I know there must be typos in the posts. I have decided to not polish them a 
lot before publishing them, in order to not slow down the publication rate. 
I think it's a reasonable trade-off. If you find typos, email me! 
(This quantity/quality trade-off also explains the simple pen drawings.)
* The picture at the beginning of the posts, are there to identify easily the 
posts and are usually not related to the content.
