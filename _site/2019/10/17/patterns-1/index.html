<p>Michel Habib and I have quite recentely finished the paper 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05913">Graph classes and forbidden patterns on three vertices</a>. 
This blog post is the first of a small series to present the paper, 
following the structure of a talk I gave yesterday at the University of Chile.</p>

<h2 id="why-studying-graph-classes">Why studying graph classes?</h2>

<p>This paper is about graph classes, and it seems that it is topic 
that is not popular with everybody, so let’s start with a couple of 
reasons to study graph classes:</p>

<h3 id="graphs-are-fundamental-objects">Graphs are fundamental objects</h3>
<p>Just like sets and languages, graphs are basic objects, so gathering 
knowledge about them is always be useful.</p>

<h3 id="to-use-algorithms-in-the-real-world">To use algorithms in the “real-world”</h3>
<p>If one wants to use algorithms for real-world problems, it is likely 
that having the result about general graphs is not the most useful 
approach. There is a good proportion of the real-world instances that
belong to very special classes, and recognizing that it is the case, and 
knowning which algorithm to use in this case, is crucial. In other words,
the problem may be hard on expanders, but road networks are not expanders,
so let’s look what road networks are like.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-studying-graph-classes">Why not studying graph classes?</h2>

<p>To be fair, there is a problem with studying graph classes: 
there are way too many of them! The website 
<a href="graphclasses.org">graphclasses.org</a> lists 1600 classes, and it’s 
difficult to navigate in this jungle, to know what is an interesting
class, to know whether the class you’re working is known etc.
(although the website is a very good help).</p>

<h2 id="this-paper">This paper</h2>
<p>This paper brings a new point of view on some very classic graph classes, 
putting them all in the same framework, with algorithmic consequences.
(Thus it goes in the right direction!).</p>

<p>Actually “new” should be used with quotation marks: this point of view 
has been known for a long time for several classes. In general we use a 
lot the literature, and I cannot cite all the papers here, so keep in 
mind that most of what I’ll write about here is not new (the 70 
citations can be found in the paper).</p>

<p>Now, let’s start with two examples.</p>

<h2 id="example-1--forest">Example 1 : forest</h2>

<p>Here is a complicated characterization of the forests (e.g. the acyclic 
graphs).</p>

<p><em>Theorem:</em> A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a forest, if and only if, there exists an ordering 
of the nodes, such that there does not exist three nodes $a&lt;b&lt;c$ such 
that $(a,b)\in E$ and $(a,c)\in E$ (the pattern below).</p>

<p><em>Proof sketch</em>
$(\Rigtharrow)$ : Consider a first tree of the forest. Put the leaves 
first in the ordering and remove them from the tree, and then repeat 
with the remaining nodes of the tree (peeling the tree, by the leaves). 
Then move on to hte next etc. It is easy to check that the pattern does 
not appear.</p>

<p>$(\Leftarrow)$ : If the graph is not a forest, then there is a cycle. 
Now consider any ordering of the graph. The left-most node of the cycle
must have itw neighbors in the cycle to its right, thus the patterns 
appear.</p>

<h2 id="example-2--interval-graphs">Example 2 : interval graphs</h2>

<p>A more interesting example is interval graphs. Given a set of intervals
$S$, one can define the intersection graph of it $I(S)$, by creating one 
node for each interval and putting an edge between two nodes if the two 
corresponding intervals intersect.</p>

<p>A graph $G$ is an interval graph, if $G=I(S)$ for some set of interval $S$.</p>

<p>From the picture above, we know that a path on four vertices is an 
interval graph. A graph that is not an interval graph is the cycle on 
four vertices. Consider the following picture.</p>

<p><img src="assets/interval-2.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" height="600px" /></p>

<p>As the red node and the 
blue node are not adjacent, they must correspond to two disjoint 
intervals, and without loss of generality, the red interval is first. 
Now, the black interval should be between the red and the blue, to reach 
both. Then the green interval should use the same space to touch the red 
and blue intervals, but in this case it would interset the black interval, 
which does not correspond to the graph.</p>

<p>Now a vertex ordering characterization.</p>

<p><em>Theorem:</em> A graph $G=(V,E)$ is an interval graphs, if and only if, 
there exists an ordering of the nodes, such that there does not exist 
three nodes $a&lt;b&lt;c$ such that $(a,b)\notin E$ and $(a,c)\in E$ 
(the pattern below).</p>

<p><img src="assets/interval-pattern.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" height="600px" /></p>

<p><em>Proof sketch:</em> 
The key idea for the proof is to consider the ordering of the left 
endpoints of the intervals. It is easy to see that the pattern cannot 
appear for a set of interval, and it is also easy to build the intervals 
from such an ordereing, by putting the left endpoints in this order, and 
then placing the right endpoint at the left-endpoint of its right-most 
neighbor in the graph.</p>
