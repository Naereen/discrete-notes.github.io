Many things have gone online, including talks and conferences. A small post with
pointers.

## Online seminars

Many seminars have moved to online settings.

* Terence Tao has a 
[list of list of online maths seminars](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/mathematics-seminars-list/), 
including [Online maths seminars](http://math.mit.edu/~aosun/online_seminars.html) 
that has more than 15 talks per day (in all kinds of mathematics).

* The same thing but speciafically for TCS can be found 
[here](https://cstheorytalks.wordpress.com/). (One or two talks per day.)

* Aalto university also has [its seminar](https://users.aalto.fi/~uittoj3/seminar.html) 
(that is not listed (yet?) in the lists above).

* The online TCS seminar, [TCS+](https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/) has 
increased its frequency from one per month to one per week (and all the previous 
talks are available). 

* The Simons Institute also has a lot of good videos, see 
[here](https://simons.berkeley.edu/videos).


## Online courses

Many universities have MOOCs, or at least videos of some classes. 

* Jukka Suomela has just started a new iteration of his parallel programming 
class, and this year of course everything is online. The videos are 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2RY7P3JxZN9Eeu2-XUbD4E4N3UNL6PV8).

* MIT has, for example, videos lectures 
[about lower bounds](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-890-algorithmic-lower-bounds-fun-with-hardness-proofs-fall-2014/),
and [advanced data structures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-851-advanced-data-structures-spring-2012/)

## Online conferences

Conferences that were suppose to take place this spring or this summer decide one
by one to held virtually. This is the case of [ICALP](https://icalp2020.saarland-informatics-campus.de/)
and [STOC](http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/) for example.

The ACM issued a guide on how to organize such online conferences. The pdf is 
[here](https://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/acm/VirtualConferences_GuideToBestPractices_CURRENT.pdf).
